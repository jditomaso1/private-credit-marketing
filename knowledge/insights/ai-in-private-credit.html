      <h2>1. The Private Credit Market Is Too Big, Too Fragmented, and Too Manual for Human-Only Workflows</h2>
      <p>Private credit grew fast — but the infrastructure never caught up.</p>

      <p>Most credit funds, regardless of size, still run core processes on:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>spreadsheets</li>
        <li>shared drives</li>
        <li>scattered PDFs</li>
        <li>Outlook folders</li>
        <li>junior analysts manually extracting covenants</li>
        <li>associates building surveillance reports by hand</li>
        <li>portfolio managers juggling dozens of trackers</li>
      </ul>

      <p>This system worked at $1 trillion. It does not work at $5 trillion.</p>

      <h3>The structural challenges AI solves immediately</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Document overload</strong> — every deal has a massive document pack.</li>
        <li><strong>Underwriting bottlenecks</strong> — deals move faster than teams can analyze.</li>
        <li><strong>Monitoring gaps</strong> — issues appear only after covenant failures.</li>
        <li><strong>Fragmented data</strong> — scattered between CRM, Excel, PDFs, and emails.</li>
        <li><strong>Analyst burnout</strong> — repetitive, high-stakes work that never stops.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>AI isn’t replacing analysts — it’s doing what burns them out so they can focus on structuring and judgment.</p>

      <h2>2. AI Is Reshaping Every Stage of the Private Credit Lifecycle</h2>
      <p>AI is impacting five major workflows:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Origination</li>
        <li>Underwriting</li>
        <li>Legal & Documentation</li>
        <li>Portfolio Monitoring</li>
        <li>Risk & Optimization</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Stage 1: AI in Origination — Sourcing Deals Before Competitors</h3>
      <p>AI predicts borrower behavior, refinancing windows, leverage pressure, and sponsor activity — giving lenders an informational edge months before teasers circulate.</p>

      <h3>Stage 2: AI in Underwriting — Turning Weeks into Hours</h3>
