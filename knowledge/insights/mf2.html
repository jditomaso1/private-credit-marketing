      <h1>AI Credit Agreement Reader:<br>Turning Legal Documents Into Deal Intelligence</h1>

      <p>Credit agreements are the backbone of private credit — the rulebook that governs every borrower relationship. They define leverage limits, covenants, reporting obligations, baskets, carveouts, liquidity requirements, events of default, amendment rights, and every mechanism that protects lenders.</p>
